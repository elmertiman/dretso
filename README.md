# DT Screening - To-Do List

## Overview
This is a simple To-Do List web app built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Use "Enter" key to add tasks

## How I Built It
I started by building the basic HTML structure, then added styling for responsiveness. I focused on DOM manipulation and event handling in vanilla JavaScript to meet the functional requirements.

## Time Taken
I completed the core features within 2 hours. If I had more time, I would add animations and a dark mode toggle.
